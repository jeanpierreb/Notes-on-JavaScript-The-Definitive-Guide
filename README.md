# Notes: JavaScript The Definitive Guide 
by David Flanagan

These are notes I took while studying this phenomenal book. The notes are organized by chapter and section. This is a JavaScript course of study largely inspired by [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/). This is meant to be a detailed treatment of the JavaScript langauge. My notes are on this repo's wiki, [read them here](https://github.com/jeanpierreb/Notes-on-JavaScript-The-Definitive-Guide/wiki)
