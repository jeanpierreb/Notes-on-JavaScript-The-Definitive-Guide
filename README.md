# Notes: JavaScript The Definitive Guide 
by David Flanagan

These are notes I took while studying this phenomenal book. The notes loosely follow the structure of Flanagan's book by chapter and section, although I depart from that where it makes more sense to me. This is a JavaScript course of study largely inspired by [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/). This is meant to be a detailed treatment of the JavaScript langauge. Read the entire thing on [Gitbook](https://github.com/jeanpierreb/Notes-on-JavaScript-The-Definitive-Guide/wiki)
