# JavaScript Notes
by Jean-Pierre Barthelemy

##Preface

These are notes I took while studying this phenomenal book. The notes loosely follow the structure of Flanagan's book by chapter and section, although I depart from that where it makes more sense to me. I wrote this book for myself, but if it helps you, feel free to use any part of it so long as you don't turn around and sell it. Any original material in this book is covered by the MIT license. This book is still a work in progress and have not/will not copy any parts of Flanagan's fantastic book in here.  I highly suggest that anyone even moderately serious about learning JavaScript pick up his book.

This is a JavaScript course of study largely inspired by [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/). This is meant to be a detailed treatment of the JavaScript langauge. Read the entire thing on [Gitbook](http://jeanpier_re.gitbooks.io/notes-on-javascript-the-definitive-guide/content/)
