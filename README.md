# Notes: JavaScript The Definitive Guide 
by David Flanagan

These are notes I took while studying this phenomenal book. The notes loosely follow the structure of Flanagan's book by chapter and section, although I depart from that where it makes more sense to me. This is a JavaScript course of study largely inspired by [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/). This is meant to be a detailed treatment of the JavaScript langauge. Read the entire thing on [Gitbook](http://jeanpier_re.gitbooks.io/notes-on-javascript-the-definitive-guide/content/)

# Overview

JavaScript (officially ECMAScript) is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It is most commonly used in web browsers where it can repond to user interaction, control the browser, asynchronously load data and alter the document content being displayed.

It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments like Node.js. It is the language of interaction on the web.

**History**

JavaScript was originally developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich, while he was working for Netscape.

JavaScript is a component of every major web browser, making it the most popular programming language in the world.

**European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA):** the organizing body that governs and develops the ECMAScript standard, commonly known as JavaScript
