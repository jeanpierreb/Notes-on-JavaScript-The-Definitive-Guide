# Chapter 1 Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript (the untrademarked name used for the standard), is a dynamic programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications. With the rise of the single-page web app and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static languages. In particular, Emscripten and highly optimised JIT compilers, in tandem with asm.js that is friendly to AOT compilers like OdinMonkey, have enabled C and C++ programs to be compiled into JavaScript and execute at near-native speeds, causing JavaScript to be considered the "assembly language of the web", according to its creator and others.

The book is divided up into four parts.

**Part I - Core JavaScript** 
JavaScript langauge itself

**Part II - Client Side JavaScript**
JavaScripit APIs as implemented in web browsers and touches on the jQuery library as well as HTML5

**Part III**
Core JavaScript Reference

**Part IV**
Client-Side JavaScript Reference
